## Starfleet Security Log ##  **is an open-source cybersecurity research repository dedicated to documenting and analyzing threats, vulnerabilities, and emerging risks affecting aerospace, satellite, and space-based systems.**

As humanity’s reliance on orbital infrastructure grows—supporting GPS, communications, aviation, defense, weather monitoring, and global connectivity—the attack surface extends far beyond Earth. This project exists to track, organize, and contextualize cybersecurity developments impacting the final frontier.

# Purpose & Scope
This repository serves as a living security log that curates:
- Open-source news and research on satellite and aerospace cybersecurity
- Analysis of real-world attack surfaces such as:
- Satellite command-and-control systems
- Ground stations
- Communication links
- Firmware and software dependencies
- Space-related supply chains
Observations on emerging threat patterns, nation-state activity, and systemic risk.
Each entry focuses on understanding the security implications, not exploiting them.
