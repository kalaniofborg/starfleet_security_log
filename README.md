## Starfleet Security Log  **is an open-source cybersecurity research repository dedicated to documenting and analyzing threats, vulnerabilities, and emerging risks affecting aerospace, satellite, and space-based systems.**

As humanity’s reliance on orbital infrastructure grows, supporting GPS, communications, aviation, defense, weather monitoring, and global connectivity; the attack surface extends far beyond Earth. This project exists to track, organize, and contextualize cybersecurity developments impacting the final frontier.

# Purpose & Scope
This repository serves as a living security log that curates:
- Open-source news and research on satellite and aerospace cybersecurity
- Analysis of real-world attack surfaces such as:
- Satellite command-and-control systems
- Ground stations
- Communication links
- Firmware and software dependencies
- Space-related supply chains
  
Observations on emerging threat patterns, nation-state activity, and systemic risk. <br>
**Each entry focuses on understanding the security implications, not exploiting them.**

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- Relevant articles or research
- Improved summaries or impact analysis
- Additional defensive insights

**All contributions should align with the project’s ethical and educational mission.**
